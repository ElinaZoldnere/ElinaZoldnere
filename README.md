Iâ€™m an electrical engineer now interested in coding, development, and IT. I'm looking forward to back-end development and have an additional interest in blockchains and Web3 technologies. Anyway, I feel I need some solid basics first.

Currently I am learning:
  - *'CS50's Introduction to Computer Science'* by HarvardX (C language)
  - *'Learn Git & GitHub'* by Codecademy
  
 Also, I have enrolled in the Riga TechGirls *'Mentorship program 2023'* in back-end development and am looking forward to productive cooperation with my Mentor.
  
 Since July 2022 I have accomplished:
  - *'Introduction to Programming (2 weeks)'* by Codelex (Typescript)
  - *'Discover Tech'* by Riga TechGirls
  - *'Learn Javascript'* by Codecademy
  - *'Learn the Command Line'* by Codecademy
  - *'Introduction to Blockchain and Crypto'* by Codecademy
  
 Here in GitHub I have deployed my practical projects and homework, but due to principles of academic honesty, not all of them I can make available publicly (like problem sets from HarvardX or exercises from Codelex).
