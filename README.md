Iâ€™m an electrical engineer now interested in coding, development, and the world of technology. 
I am seeking an entry-level position while aiming ultimately to evolve into a DevOps Engineer or Back-end Software Engineer. I also have an additional interest in blockchains and Web3 technologies. 
At the moment I am working torwards a solid foundation of knowledge, taking 'Introduction to Computer Science', an online course by Harvard University.

Currently, I am taking:
  - *'CS50's Introduction to Computer Science'* by HarvardX (C, Python)
  - *'Learn Git & GitHub'* by Codecademy
  
 Since July 2022 I have accomplished:
  - *'Mentorship program 2023'* in back-end development by Riga TechGirls
  - *'Discover Tech'* by Riga TechGirls
  - *'Learn Javascript'* by Codecademy
  - *'Introduction to Programming (2 weeks)'* by Codelex (Typescript)
  - *'Learn the Command Line'* by Codecademy
  - *'Introduction to Blockchain and Crypto'* by Codecademy
  
 Here in GitHub I have deployed my practical projects and homework. Still, due to principles of academic honesty, I can not make them available publicly, but they are available upon request.
