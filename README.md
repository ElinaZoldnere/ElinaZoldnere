Iâ€™m an electrical engineer now interested in coding, development, and IT. I'm looking forward to back-end development and have an additional interest in blockchains and Web3 technologies. Anyway, I feel I need some solid basics first.

So currently I am learning:
  - *'CS50's Introduction to Computer Science'* by HarvardX (C language)
  - *'Learn Git & GitHub'* by Codecademy
  
 Since July I have accomplished:
  - *'Introduction to Programming (2 weeks)'* by Codelex (Typescript)
  - *'Discover Tech'* by Riga TechGirls
  - *'Learn Javascript'* by Codecademy
  - *'Learn the Command Line'* by Codecademy
  
  Here in GitHub I have deployed my practical projects and homework, but due to principles of academic honesty, not all of them I can make available publicly (like problem sets from HarvardX or exercises from Codelex).
